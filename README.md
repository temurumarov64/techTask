The counter in the dashboard receives the calculations from the server; and because the server is free, it is not as quick as desired, but okay for now.

My backend is https://github.com/temurumarov64/node-express-vercel; 
It is deployed on a free vercel server: https://node-express-vercel-sable.vercel.app/
My front sends requests to that server, and 3 APIs are sending responses; JWT tokens are needed with each request to obtain the responses;
